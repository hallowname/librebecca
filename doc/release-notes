VERSION 1.1tp3

Vastly improved international support across 
all programming languages and tools.  Dialects
will work with the eclipse plugin now.  It will
also work correctly with the rs-admin tool.  Also,
directories with dialects will work correctly.  
Lastly, upper casing, lower casing, and formal 
casing will work correctly with dialects.

Fixed a bug where escaped XML elements such as 
&lt; &gt; were not operating correctly.  This 
effected reversed aiml.

Enhanced empty conditionals where they will now
correctly allow you to use an empty string for 
a condition and it will return true if the predicate
does not exist.

Fixed a nasty bug where if you have multiple star's 
and multiple users it would return an empty false 
positive string.

VERSION 1.1tp2

Upgrade to Berkeley DB 4.6.19

Upgraded to ICE 3.2.1

Upgraded to xerces 2.8.0

Fixed a bug with the networking C++ api where
addDirectoryUnlessAlreadyAdded was calling the wrong
order of arguments

Fixed a bug where the directory containing the 
embedded database would not create its self if it was 
on version of Windows XP which was not English based.

VERSION 1.1tp1

A windows installer

An Eclipse plugin for using Eclipse as an AIML editor

An embedded database engine for all AIML processing

Support for a multitude of programming languages such
as C++, C#, Java, and Python

Excellent, fully documented, and easy to use APIs for 
various programming languages

Support for safe and concurrent multi-process access to AIML

Support for safe and concurrent multi-threading access to AIML

Includes command line tools to access and manipulate the 
AIML embedded database

Support for multiple users, multiple bots the users can have, 
and multiple end users accessing the users' bots

Scalability. RebeccaAIML can support an infinite number of users, 
bots, and, end users as long as you have hard drive space for more.

Near zero start times. Regardless of your number of users, bots, 
end users, RebeccAIML will restart in ~ 1 second.

A configurable amount of memory. Utilizing the embedded database tools 
you can configure how much memory RebeccaAIML will use for caching 
as well as fine tune her from a small machine to a large rack server.

Server and client model included. RebeccaAIML starts as a service and 
runs as a server in the background waiting for queries

Fixed random where it was not all that random.  Before it was 
seeding the same time for every call to its getString().  Now, 
it is more randomized as the seeding occurs only in its 
constructor.

The framework no longer requires boost.  You can extend and use
the framework without having boost as a preqrequiste.  This will
help those who have downloaded a binary version but do not have
the boost libary to develop against the framework version.

Fixed a bug with the parsing config files from xerces.  I now use 
full paths when passing XML files to xerces.

Fixed a bug where the <set> could not set empty strings.  Now, 
when you hand set an empty string it will unset the AIML variable.

I removed the call to createGraph() from within getResponse().  
I fixed the learn tag to not have to use that hack anymore.

I Fixed the way that you used to have to use a screwy relative path to the 
.xsd's in some of the api's.  Now you use either a relative path from the 
executable or an absolute path to the xsd's.

Removed the Dialog.aiml file since that file was Pandora bot specific.

Thread safe but it's at the top most method level for right now.  Latter 
it'll be refined at lower levels.

Sweeping change of eliminating as many const * char * const's as possible 
and instead having StringPimpl as the replacement.  This will cause some 
api's to break and abi to break completely.  The adjustment is not that 
horrible though and usually a simple recompilation is all that is needed.

Rewrote the handle responses mechanism.  It's now documented within 
GraphBuilder as well as its an improved version both in correctness 
as well as speed.

Removed the internal class PrototypeFactory and made Factory abstract 
instead of an interface.  The extra class PrototypeFactory was a bit of 
overkill.  Now, the internal GraphBuilder's all come from Factory.

Removed clone() from the GraphBuilderAIML implementation.  It's no longer
needed since I removed PrototypeFactory.


VERSION .9871

I now include the executable, regression, in both the Windows 
and Linux prebuilt packages.  This is for downloaders to be 
able to verify the quality of Rebecca for the version they 
download.

I also added the regression test suite to the autoconf build system
where it builds it by default.  This is for those who port RebeccaAIML 
to another platform to be able to run regression tests to ensure the 
quality of the port.  Use "./configure --help" to see all the autoconf
options available.

Updated the code for the regression testing.  It now uses header and 
footer html files in resources/testing instead of having the html 
hard coded.  Fixed it to output <br/> instead of the incorrect <br> 
for html page breaks.  I also improved it to be dll boundary safe by 
having it use Tag::instanceOf() instead of dynamically casting through
dynamic_cast<>().

I also added an Arguments class to regression to enable a smooth
transition over to autoconf

VERSION .987

Condition and Li were not handling empty string cases 
correctly.  See the latest regression tests in the 
documentation for the exact case.

Li::getPredicateName() and Li::getAimlPattern() are 
now const methods.  This change will break abi compatiblity 
with anyone using the framework but not api compatibility
with the framework.  Those using the framework will have to 
recompile and relink against this new version.  

Added these methods to the framework on the class Li:

bool Li::isDefaultListItem() 
 It returns true if the Li is a default list item or not.

bool Li::isValueOnlyListItem() 
 It returns true if the Li is a value only list item.

bool Li::isNameAndValueListItem() 
 It returns true if the Li is a name and value list.

Added these methods to the framework on the class Condition:

bool Condition::isBlockCondition()
 Returns true if this Condition is a block condition 
 otherwise it will return false.

bool Condition::isSinglePredicateCondition()
 Returns true if this Condition is a single predicate
 condition otherwise it will return false.

bool Condition::isMutliPredicateCondition()
 Returns true if this Condition is a multi-predicate
 condition otherwise it will return false.

Updated documentation for GraphBuilder::callSystemCommand()

Removed the documentation about the bug aboug xsd not being validated.  
I really should have removed this a *long* time ago, but it's 
removed now.
 
See the doxygen documentation for more details of these 
new methods and updates.

VERSION .9861

Whenever topic was being set it was not calling srai's correctly.
This was due to a bad logging call.

VERSION .986

Fixed bug with PlainWordImpl::trimToOneSpace where
I was not checking if the size of a string was greater
than zero before using it.

Fixed a bug with srai where the star indexes were not being
calculated right during srai.

Fixed a bug where rebecca would not let go of her internal 
AIML file and string caching system.

Upgraded the qtgui and tested it underneath QT 4.1.4 

Added the Callback method Callbacks::learnTagFileNotFound()
for when the AIML XML learn tag cannot find a file it will 
call this callback.  This will allow the programmer to handle
file not founds for AIML XML programmatically.

Added a new method GraphBuilder::callSystemCommand() which acts 
the same as calling the AIML XML tag "System" by sending the 
command to the operating system and returning the output of 
the command.

VERSION .985

Added autoconf support for Unix'es and Linux.  Now
you can compile using, "configure; make; make install".
See the doc/linuxINSTALL.txt in the distribution for 
information on how to utilize this.  

Added an Arguments class to each sample.  The purpose
of this is two fold.  One is to show how you could 
parse arguments when utilizing RebeccaAIML api and the 
second is to make the installers of the samples 
easier to write in the future.  

The Arguments class now gives a few switches with each sample.  
See the source code of each sample for the list of available switches.
However, you can type "console.exe -help" or 
"consoleAIMLHtmlConverter.exe -help" to get a list of the switches too.  

Added RPM support to the build.  In the download section you should now
be able to download RPM's for Rebecca for several flavors of Fedora Core.

Tweaked the source files to work with gcc 4.1.0

VERSION .984

Added the feature of being able to add AIML strings to 
Rebecca on the fly through the method 
GraphBuilder.addString("aiml string").  You can add a whole
category programatically as easily as:

builder.addString
	(
	   "<category>"
	   "<pattern>test aiml string</pattern>"
	   "<template>it simply works!</template>"
	   "</category>"
	);			

Added the learn tag per AIML 1.0.1 specification.

Fixed the gender, person, and person2 tag implementations 
to pass all of the regression tests.

Fixed the addFile and addDirectory to be tolerant of adding
files which are native to the file system.  Before you could
at best portably use relative strings.  Now you can use just
about any file system string for GraphBuilder.addFile() and
GraphBuilder.addDirectory().  As a result of this I was able
to simply part of the qtGUI core to using whichever native 
absolute paths that came from Windows or Unix.

See the documentation of these methods for more details:
http://rebecca-aiml.sourceforge.net/documentation.htm


Under the covers updated and changed the Transcode to translate 
both from xerces xml strings and to xerces xml strings.  


VERSION .983

Bug fix release.

I fixed a bug reported by Charles Chevallier where
when srai is called the input AIML tags behaved 
incorrectly. To fix this bug I had to alter the signature 
of GraphBuilderFramework.checkedInfiniteLoopGetResponse().
It now has a new boolean argument variable 
"keepPreviousUserInput".  You set this to false if you 
do not want the previous user input stored internally.  
Usually you only want to set this to false when you call 
this from implementations of the Srai AIML tag.

I fixed a bug reported by Charles Chaevallier where
when punctuation is at the begining of a Rebecca 
Response it would cause her to crash.

I fixed a one-off error where I incorrectly indexed 
some of the internal data structures and this would
cause a crash.

Made the stack operational thanks to a missing predicate
found by Ryan Neill

Put in more bot properties (the most common ones), thanks 
to Ryan Neill for pointing this out to me.


VERSION .982

Bug fix release.  

I fixed a bug under Linux for the 
GraphBuilder::addCustomTagLibrary method.  It would load 
the string given as soname.so when it should have loaded 
it as libsoname.so.  

I also fixed a bug reported by Charles Chevallier where 
Rebecca was not erasing commas before storing strings into 
her internal "that" variable.  I added a regression test 
case for it so the bug will not reappear.

I also fixed the "System" AIML tag to be able to return 
the string now under both Windows and Linux.  Now the 
regression test for the "System" tag works!


VERSION .981

Added a new cross platform simple QT GUI to the samples
section to showcase how you would program a GUI with
the RebeccaAIML engine.

Fixed a bug where when you call new and delete on
AIMLFacade or StringPimpl it would crash under Windows
if you were mixing and matching Debug and Release.  Now,
new and delete are dll boundary safe.   

Forgot to put .98 in VERSION .98 for the 
GraphBuilderAIML::getVersion().  So, all resulting programs 
built using .98 will report they are version .972 when they 
encounter the AIML XML Tag <version>. Fixed that in this version, 
it will say .981 when the <version> tag is encountered.


VERSION .98

I opened up the RebeccaAIML framework in which you can
inherit from AIML XML Tag classes to add or modify the
current working set.  You will need Boost C++ library
to use the framework.  With the release of the framework
you can now add your own custom AIML XML Tag dll or shared
object in which you can change the functionality of the 
engine.  The framework is fully documented and I provide
a sample which overrides all the AIML XML Tags to provide
a Html converter.  It converts AIML XML files into html pages 
with links.  The html pages provide a way to "cruise" 
through the AIML brain and see how the brain would look like 
in memory.


VERSION .972

Copy constructor of StringPimpl was not setting its 
private implementation handle to 0 and when it was 
called it would try to delete and in turn crash 
RebeccaAIML. 

I also changed the default precompiled windows 
binary to be multithreaded dll instead of just 
multithreaded.


VERSION 0.971

Enabled true multi-lined that's.  Now Rebecca can pass
another regression test involving multi-lined that's.  
Also now the that index's involving previous input's and
previous sentences works correctly.


VERSION 0.97


A new regression testing system has been put into place.
The regression test suite is that of ProgramD's.  However,
in the future I will add more test cases which should work
for both the test regression suite here and for ProgramD's.
How that is accomplished is through the use of xml to define
the test cases.  This is all from the work of Joel on ProgramD.
From the regression testing, I have found bugs and made more 
fixes to this release.  I also have found a few bugs which I will 
fix in an upcomming release.

This release fixes yet another bug with the condition 
tag.  The condition tag before only accepted AIML tags 
for the result of a succesful condition.  Now regular text 
can be added as well to the condition tag as it should be.  I also 
fixed up white space problems with this release as well as made
the exceptions of FileNotFound and DirectoryNotFound more verbose.


VERSION 0.96


This release fixes a bug in which the AIML tag "Condition" 
did not work at all.  Also this release fixes the AIML.xsd.
Therefore, I have enabled Schema validation in this release.

With schema validation enabled, bad AIML tags will be reported 
to their respective callbacks and the XML parser automatically
handles not adding bad AIML to the graph builder.  Thus your 
callbacks will alert you to bad AIML tags, and your graph builder
should still remain bullet proof. See the documentation for 
more details on XML callbacks through the class CallBacks. 


VERSION 0.951


Fixed the "muliti-lined that" bug.  This bug was minor 
but an annoyance.  Whenver a "that" has more than one line
the last line should be choosen as a that.

VERSION 0.95


Initial release.  All AIML tags are implemented except 
for <learn> and the java script.

There is currently a bug with the AIML.xsd that does 
not allow the AIML tag <set> to validate correctly.  So
for the time being I have removed the AIML.xsd validation
but will put it back as soon as that is fixed.

* WELCOME!

This is the RebeccaAIML Project.  

RebeccaAIML is an enterprise cross platform open source 
AIML development platform. RebeccaAIML supports C++, Java,
C#, and Python as well as many other programming languages
and AIML development out of the box.  RebeccaAIML also 
comes with an array of AIML administration tools, great 
documentation, and an eclipse AIML editor plugin. 

{ From the redistributor: 

## NOTE: This distrobution is not the official RebeccaAIML
project, but a re-distrobution for GNU/Linux users, because 
the authors source code was written in Visual Studio and didn't
play well with modern Linux machines. This source has been
successfully tested on Ubuntu and Gentoo machines, with only
standard Ubuntu .debs and standard Gentoo .ebuilds.

HOWEVER, This is not the authors release, the last release from
the original author was in 2007.

* PROGRAMMING WITH THE API AND FRAMEWORK

So how do you start programming with the API and/or framework?  
For a quick start check out the source code of the samples.  
you'll find them under [src\samples]. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

* THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE APIs AND FRAMEWORK

Where's the full documentation of the APIs and FRAMEWORK at?  You can 
find the documentation of the api and framework in the [doc] directory.
under Linux that's  [/usr/share/librebecca/doc]

You can also find more documentation at the RebeccaAIML website: 
http://rebecca-aiml.sourceforge.net/documentation.htm

------------------------------------------------------------------

* COMPILING THE SOURCE CODE OF THE ENGINE

I want to compile the complete source code of the engine and not 
just the samples.  How do I do that?

[/usr/share/librebecca/doc/linuxInstall.txt] for Linux.

------------------------------------------------------------------

* DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE DIRECTORIES AND FILES

Can you give me an overview of all the files and directories of 
RebeccaAIML?  Under Windows these files are located at 
[<wherever_you_installed>\...] and under Linux these files are 
located at [/usr/share/Rebecca]

If you have the source or binary distribution you
have the following directories of:

[aiml]      Varoius AIML data sets that are included 
            with the RebeccaAIML distribution and used 
			by the samples.

[conf]      Various configuration files that the samples
            use when they load.

[doc]       Where all the documentation is located. 
            Everything from the API documentation, user guide,
            to how to install Rebecca from full source 
            code is here.

[include]   All the include files for building against 
            RebeccaAIML with C++.  
            			
[resources] Various resource files needed by every sample 
            is located here.  
			
[src]       Source code of samples and the RebeccaAIML 
            engine if you downloaded the source code.

If you have the source code distribution you have 
a few extra added directories of:

[src/rebecca]           Source code of the engine			  

[include/rebecca/impl]  Header files only needed for building
                        the engine.

TODO ICE:
- Check that everything calls aiml.destroy() and use an integer status such as python, java, and C#
- The client side(s) all have to be able to set by default ACM disabled for bidirectional
  communication to work effectively. 
- Thread safety of setUserId, and getUserId, and setBotId, getBotId, and the other methods?
  Should they be thread safe?  Or should there just be a disclaimer that they're not thread 
  safe.
- Change the default Exceptions of python, java, C# to have some message in them like in C++
  so that whenever one is thrown with no message a default message is used
- Fix the exceptions in the java, c#, etc... to only catch what they need to catch which is
  networkException and exception
- There's a lot of files being hand copied into the bin\release directory 
  right now.  There has to be an easier way to setup to pull those files 
  over.  Otherwise the developer documentation for building RebeccaAIML is 
  going to be dreadful.
- Fix the problem with rs-admin not taking too kindly to --Ice.Config, it crashes.
- Test all the networked programs to see if they can work with --Ice.Config's on Becky's computer
- For C++ add a #include <rebecca_network_all.h>
- Add network specific commands to read from the remote computer the files.  Change the 
  regular addDirectory, addFile to actually send the file(s) as strings over the wire.
- Double check the comments for the public api's on the client sides
- Make precompilation steps check for ICE variables and if they exist
- Make precompilation steps for boost in the server side project and any others if they need it

TODO DB:
- Document the enviornment variable DB_INCLUDES, DB_LIB, etc...  Put checks for those 
  enviornment variables into Visual Studio

TODO First: 
- Remove the horrible arguments class from everything but the 
     regression test sample 
     This is the qtgui
- Update regression to output useful information and not just technical 
  information
- Update all the README's in the distro
- removeDirectoryWithFilesEndingInRegularExpression method does not exit in python?
- removeDirectoryWithFilesEndingInRegularExpression method does not exist in C#?
- Figure out way to put the setDatabaseEnviornment back so that its possible to set it before
  starting the engine.  Perhaps as a static on AimlFacade and AimlNetworkFacade.
- In the QT GUI, add a delete file list, delete directory.  Also add a "setUserId/setBotId/setEndUserId"
  in it.  
- Fix the background within QT.  Right now it is scrolling the background and looks ugly
- Add a convience constructor to networkaimlfacade that doesn't tag args.  It just 
  in turn calls ice with no args
- Update vs8_build_bin_dist to do a full up build and then build the installer
- In DBManager, I commented out the deletion of the database and database environment objects.  It 
  was crashing on the delete.  Figure out why.
- improve the server startup properties file.  It's pretty bad having "--" for everything.  Instead
  it should use a sepearate module.  Pull out the argument parsing from rs-admin.exe and put that 
  as a seperate project.  Link that to the server side.  Have the seperate argument parsing boot
  strap a "admin" user and "admin" bot and have the english natural parsed.
- update all the callbacks to use GraphBuilder.getSize() instead of the looping i in categories loaded
- Have a versioning set on the DB.  Something that we can use to test forward versioning and backwards
  versioning.  Need to have a string such as "_@reserved_@version_@1.1TP1"  Have it check for a record
  list of: "_@reserved_@versionInCompatible".  Have it compare it to its current version number.  If 
  it finds its version in that list have it exit with an error of incompatible database format.
- When the Factory is deleted have it in its destructor delete each
  of the things it has in the correct order.
- Add guards on C# and Java for null entries 
- Make a way to be able to unset the CallBacks.  Make the destroy() method of the 
  aimlFacade automatically unset the CallBacks and the server side be able to 
  remove it from the set.
- Make the server check that the config file is found and give an 
  error if it is not found instead of just checking that the number
  of arguments is non zero.
- Make rs-admin's command line more robust and useful
- Check out and fix the 64 bit problem by including the #include <stddef.h>
  Right now it won't compile on 64 bit platforms because of this.
  * Fix the whole 64 bit issue with the unsigned int's that being put into 
    the new and delete's.  This causes things to not compile underneath a 
    mac.
- Create test case for the bug where the <set> could not set empty strings
- Upgrade to the latest Java 6 version
- Upgrade to the latest QT 4.2
- Upgrade to the latest ICE version
- Upgrade to the latest Oracle DB version

autoconf TODO:
- Make autoconf work with all the latest 
- Check for the additional boost header file recursive_mutex.hpp in the autoconf files as 
  well as any other files that I might have added.
- Copy more README's to the rebecca/share directory and below.
- Fix the relative paths to the xsd's to be correct
- Change the location of the files to now become:
  bin\cpp
  bin\java
  bin\python
  bin\csharp

TODO installer:
- In the Admin->Services, RebeccaAIML does not have any description for her service
- Add the ice binary tools to the build.  I need to have included the tools that 
  do things like recover the database and what not.
- Make the core engine optional.  There's the case where they want to install clients but not server.
  Ensure though that it actually works and they are able to install just a slimmed down client side.
- Add text to make the begining cooler
- Add all the licenses and explanations of each.  Should be GPL for core, GPL for Qt and GPL for ICE and network'ed programs.  
- Add the option to install the server or not to install the server.  Sometimes they'll want to only install client side pieces 
  and not server side pieces.
- Finish up documenting all the individual install pieces
- Add the regression test suite as a section

Documentation:
- Update the framework documentation about how you don't need boost.  Right now it has directions to how you 
  need boost when you really don't need it anymore
- Document rs-admin.exe's ability to have -suids, and the ability to change userId, botId, endUserId.  
- Document the new methods in Graphbuilder
- Document the FrameworkFactory
- Document the IdentificationManager
- Document the StringPimpl with all the new added changes to it in the header file
- Update qtgui's README with the instructions for the new installer as well as for QMAKESPEC = "win32-msvc2005"
  since we're using all microsoft visual studio 2005
- Add credits for the icon to tango desktop
- Update the readme.txt specifically in the rebecca\conf directory.
  It should have more info on what exactly all the files are for.  Specifically 
  the files for the server startup and the client startup
- Add license information for ICE
- Add a ReadMe.txt to each of the projects folders as well as to them individually inside of visual studio.
  This will make it easier for the developer to Understand things if they see a ReadMe.txt in each of their 
  visual studio projects.
- Add a ReadMe.txt to each of the rebecca\bin\<language> directories.  This will describe how to run each 
  project as well as about each of the projects and directions on where the sample source code to each one 
  is located.  
- Flush out the README.txt's in the java, c#, python, etc... in each of the rebecca\bin\<language>
  Also flush out a README.txt in each of the rebecca\src\samples\<language> directory
- Finish documenting the c++ network section, as well as the java, c#, and python versions
- Fix the documentation for the xsd's.  Now they *don't* take that 
  screwed up relative path'ing to them.  Now they *DO* take direct 
  relative paths from either where the executable is executed or 
  they can take an absolute path
- Document these server side properties
	* Rebecca.Server.Config.AimlSchema
	* Rebecca.Server.Config.CommonTypesSchema
	* Rebecca.Server.Config.BotConfigurationSchema
	* Rebecca.Server.Config.SubstitutionFile
	* Rebecca.Server.Config.SentenceSplitterFile
	* Rebecca.Server.Config.PropertiesFile
	* Rebecca.Server.Config.PortNumber
	* Rebecca.Server.Config.HostName
	* Rebecca.Server.Config.Name
- Document these client side properties
	* Rebecca.Client.Config.HostName
	* Rebecca.Client.Config.portNumber
- Document all the networked options for ICE and provide commented out
  samples for them.
- Add a user manual
  * Should have server setup for services and Unix dameon and what not
    trouble shooting the server and what not.
  * Documentation about rs-admin.
  * Quick start guide for building C++, C#, Java, etc... language 
    based clients  
  
- Create a properties configuration file for an example for the server
- Create a properties configuration file for an example for the client
- Document the samples, java csharp, python, etc...
- Document the network.ice file
- Document in the developer build documents how they have to add the ICE binaries
  to their path
- Document how to run the ICE commands for developers.  Also document how to build
  everything from scratch.
- Add the Copyright and GNU license to all the header files
- Update the createGraph() documentation to include that structures can be added 
  through the "addString" method
- Create a User's guide to Rebecca for the various configuration and scenario's.

Future:
- Readd the reverse tag and expose it for others to see an easy way to use the framework.
- Do a partial transaction for safety.  Do transaction on the list of files that are about to be 
  added that are added to the internal DB list of files to add.  Then do another transaction on 
  the files that have just been added to the DB.  But DO NOT do a transaction on adding files into
  the brain.
- Make AimlFacade reference counted.  Once there's no more AimlFacade's left have it delete the 
  Factory.  Otherwise, right now you could have multiple AimlFacades accross Threads and what not 
  and the first to leave scope would crash the system.
- Check all the m_userId, m_botId, m_endUserId in networkGraphBuilder, java, C#, python.  Is this 
  what we want with the setUserIdBotIdEndUserId?  Set locally?  No thread safety either with this?
- Make the GraphBuilder::addAIMLString and GraphBuilder::removeString keep track of categories by setSize
  and getSize
- Add to GraphBuilder::addToDB(String, String), String getFromDB(String), String existsInDB(String)
  for admin purposes and what not.
- Should NodeMapper be a singleton?  A NodeManager class?  How many instances of it are in the system?
  I think only one instance is now created.  It probably should be a singelton.
- Add a DB keys class and put all the keys into that as StringPimpl const.  
  Make it a ton easier for debugging and adjusting.
- Fix previousSrai to use the recordCount instead of hand written counting and deleting
- Fix PreviousResponseManager to use the recordCount instead of hand written counting and deleting
- In ConfigurationHandler, ConfigurationHandlerError, and GraphHandler, GraphHandlerError
  I overuse the GraphBuilderAIML::getInstance().
  Should I be using this?  More than likely it should be an instance variable.  
- Finish the NodeMapper::remove() to remove all the other parts of the bot brain and not just the 
  last node.
- Fix crash on the server where if more than one callback enbabled program is running and one
  shuts down an iterator error occurs.  This is due to the iterator being invalidated by the 
  broken connection.
- Add aysnch methods so that you can do certain operations like addDirectoryAsynch() and it will
  return immediately.  Don't have one on things that return back values obviously.
- Create sample applications in batch file(s) under dos and bash scripts under Linux
- Check out the email from Daniel Piñol, "[Rebecca-aiml-general] memory leaks" it's about
  memory leaks in Rebecca
- Split out the StringPimpl and others into another .dll.  We don't 
  want a dependency on Xercesc when just using the client.  Let's 
  name this .dll rebecca-utils-mt.dll
- Memory management rules for the previous user responses, previous 
  bot responses.  Ways to store those out along side the predicates 
  perhaps too.
- Make methods on the builder for policies based on what to do when hitting 
    identical "PATTERN <that> THAT <topic> TOPIC"  They would be:
        * skip
        * append
        * overwrite
        * combine
- Fix the html generator to have a CustomLearn tag
- Make a callback for when an identical "PATTERN <that> THAT <topic> TOPIC" is
    encountered it will call the callback.
- Problem with Category.  It gives incorrect number whenever it hasn't technically 
  loaded anything.  This happens when duplicate categories are loaded.  Need a way 
  to be able to distinguish what's a unique category loaded versus a non unique category.
- Simplify the current C++ server/client mixed versions more.  Split out the 
  arguments into other classes so people don't have to deal with their implementation
  and can just look at the main() of them instead.
- Add the ability to parse one category at a time and return.  This will be a semi-blocking 
  createGraph() and will improve the responsiveness.  Might want to just add multi-threading
  and skip this one.
- Add ability to save out predicates on the server end.
  * Add the api to get the predicates period.  Then use the api on the server end
    to optionally save the predicates.
- Add a clear() method to the ice server that clears out all the aiml files.
  * Also add this clear to the rs-admin too.
  * Add a remove() method api and the internals to remove AIML
- Create the Visual Basic version
- Add a QtGui program to the network version as QtGUINetwork
- Make pattern side <bot's> work within pattern and then create a test case for it.  For example, 
  <pattern>hi <bot name="name"/></pattern> should work.
- From Pippijn, add a callback for <set> and provide the key/value pair to the user.
  Also add api's so the user can get all the currently set values in some type of 
  list so that they can save them out if they want to.
- Make the xml engine pluggable so that something such as libexpat could be used in place of xerces
- Add api for return name when set
- Make rebecca be able to use the <learn> tag from pandora bots as a layer
- Make Rebecca parse predicates.xml so that she can set predicates as well as the "return name when set".
- Make Rebecca set the predicate top in the predicates.xml to OM and 
     remove the top being set in the Predicates.aiml file.
- Should we perhaps make a utility dll/so?  At the least should we make a
  Prediacates class that encompasses the read/write predicates with a factory
  that can be set in the builder class.  That way the user can define their
  behvaoir of what to do with reading and writing the predicates 
- Support mulituser enviornment.  You can switch users through a "id"
- Add the Javascript engine
- Should this even be added?  Transactions is slow and locks the entire DB to make 
  it almost entirely serialized.
  Add static methods so the user can configure DB.  Right now as defaults add:
          set_cachesize 0 152428800 3
          set_lg_regionmax 4194304
          set_lg_bsize 4194304
          set_lg_max 4194304
          set_lk_max_lockers 40000
          set_lk_max_locks 40000
          set_lk_max_objects 40000

Far Future:
- Create a string wrapper header file for the GraphBuilder and others if possible.  This wrapper would 
  allow the developer to use straight strings instead of the StringPimpl class.  This might/might not 
  be feasible.  If feasible, the wrapper would be in a header file and not compiled.
- Document and release doxygen of the internal api
- Open up and document how others can make their own releases using the batch files.
